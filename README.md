# LinkedIn Automation Tool

This project is an automation tool built using Python and Selenium for performing actions on LinkedIn, such as sending connection requests and personalized messages based on user-defined inputs.

## Overview

The LinkedIn Automation Tool consists of two main Python scripts:

1. **linkedin.py**: Contains the automation code utilizing the Selenium WebDriver to perform various actions on the LinkedIn website.
2. **gui.py**: A graphical user interface script designed to interact with `linkedin.py` by collecting user inputs and passing them as arguments for the automation process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver.exe)
- Tkinter (for GUI interface)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-automation.git
   cd linkedin-automation
   ```

## Install dependencies:

Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install required Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download Chrome WebDriver:
Download the appropriate Chrome WebDriver from Chromedriver Downloads and place chromedriver.exe in the project directory.

## Usage

Run the graphical interface:

Execute the following command in the terminal:
python gui.py

Fill in the required details in the GUI:

Enter your LinkedIn username and password.
Provide the search term, company name, number of pages, and a personalized message.
Click on the "Submit" or "Run Automation" button.

Observe the automation process:

The linkedin.py script will be executed with the provided inputs, automating actions on the LinkedIn website.
The console may display progress or status messages during execution.
